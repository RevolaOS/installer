# installer

Desktop installer for RevolaOS and the Rust crates it is built on: device access over DFU, firmware input preparation, recipe assembly and bundle verification, plus the command-line tool and the on-device USB helper.

TODO: port from the RepriseOS installer and host crates.

## What drives development

1. **RAM first.** 64 MiB in total, about 20 MiB of heap shared with Apple's music database. Every pull request reports resident and peak bytes from the emulator heap profile. An increase needs a stated reason. A disabled extension costs zero bytes. Reuse what exists before adding anything.
2. **Performance second.** No work in audio callbacks beyond the DSP itself. No redraw of unchanged pixels. No disk reads for things that can be computed. No per-draw checks when a one-time hook can decide. Hot paths bind directly; the dispatcher runs only when two handlers share a site.
3. **Optimise before merge.** Measure, remove what measurement does not justify, and stop when the next step costs more clarity than it saves. "Works" is not the bar.
4. **Complexity matches need.** No abstraction for one caller, no layer that only forwards. Defer anything with one user, delete anything with none. A person must be able to reason about the code.
5. **Clean structure.** One concern per directory. Extensions never reach into core internals. Apple addresses come only from the generated symbols header.
6. **Measure, do not guess.** Emulator heap profile for every RAM claim; hardware for audio, cache and storage behaviour.

## Core or extension

Something is core only if the loader, SDK or settings store needs it, if it must act before the loader can run, or if the boot cannot recover without it. Everything else is an extension, however small. One extension per concern. If one feature cannot work without another, it is a module of that extension, not a dependency.
